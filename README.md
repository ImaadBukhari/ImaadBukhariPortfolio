# Hi I'm Imaad!

I'm an Electrical Engineering major with a minor in Applied AI studying at McGill University. I'm also the co-founder of [OmniPlane](https://omni-plane.com/) where we're building a stylus pen for AR/VR headsets. 

### What I build

I’m interested in building AI systems that actually *do something* — not just in theory, but out in the real world.

A lot of my work has focused on applying machine learning to hardware — from tracking a stylus in space using computer vision, IMU sensors, and sensor fusion, to developing embedded software that lets those systems run smoothly. I've also explored areas like realistic image synthesis, other computer vision techniques, and motion prediction as part of both my academic work and personal projects.
