# Hi I'm Imaad!

I'm an Electrical Engineering major with a minor in Applied AI studying at McGill University. I'm also the co-founder of [OmniPlane](https://omni-plane.com/) where we're building a stylus pen for AR/VR headsets. 

### What I build

I’m interested in building AI systems that actually *do something* — not just in theory, but out in the real world.

A lot of my work has focused on applying machine learning to hardware — from tracking a stylus in space using IMU sensors and sensor fusion, to developing embedded software that lets those systems run smoothly. I've also explored areas like realistic image synthesis, computer vision, and motion prediction as part of both my academic work and personal projects.

###  Projects

Some of the areas I’ve worked in:
- ✍️ **Stylus tracking & motion estimation**
- 📱 **iOS tools for data collection**
- 🎯 **Embedded systems (ESP32, LSM9DS1 IMU)**
- 🧠 **ML for gesture prediction**
- 📷 **Realistic image generation & computer vision**
